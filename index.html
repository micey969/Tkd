					<h3>My Hope</h3>
					<p> The above picture is of my friends and our Taekwondo instructor. When I look at this picture I see how far Taekwondo can go in my country once we have adequate funding
					and support. It is more than a sport, it is a discipline I will recommend to anyone to learn.</p>
						
					<p> In a country where anything is possible and crime is on the rise, I would like to see people taking the initiative to protect themselves, and not just with weapons.
					Taekwondo can be a discipline sport for troubled youths. You may think that it just provides them with new fighting skills, I do not disagree, but, clearly you have never done
					a hundred push ups on your knuckles.</p>
						
					<p>My hope for Taekwondo in St. Vincent is to see it grow to become a more prominent sport and get the recognition just like netball, swimming, soccer, etc. I would like to see it taken
					more seriously and not just as a fad to impress someone "special". My hope is to see Taekwondo persevere and to be a part of its history in my country. In the words of my instructor:</p>
						
					<p><strong>"Our strength is in the togetherness and team work that the SVGTA has always demonstrated. So may the work that we continue to do leave a rich legacy for future Taekwondins 
					in St. Vincent and the Grenadines."- Vanburn Harry, President SVGTA.</strong></p>
